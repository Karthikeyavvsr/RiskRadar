# riskradar/requirements.txt

# Core Framework
streamlit

# Data Handling
pandas
numpy
# sqlite3 is built-in, sqlite-utils not strictly needed for current app.py usage

# Finance & Data APIs
yfinance
requests
praw             # For Reddit sentiment
feedparser       # For RSS feed fallback

# API Interaction & Resilience
tenacity         # For robust retries with backoff

# Visualization
plotly
seaborn
matplotlib      # Seaborn dependency, explicitly listing is good practice
altair

# NLP & Transformers
transformers[torch] # Install torch variant for sentiment model
# Alternatively, specify torch separately:
# transformers
# torch

# Risk, Optimization, and Math
scikit-learn     # For PCA, KMeans in risk_clusterer
scipy            # Often a dependency for scientific computing, used in performance_metrics/XIRR

# --- Potentially Unused/Future Dependencies (based on provided code) ---
# cvxpy            # Optimization - Not used in provided MVP code
# quantlib         # Advanced Finance - Not used in provided MVP code
# firebase-admin   # Backend/DB - Not used in provided MVP code (using SQLite)

# --- Recommended for Development/Performance ---
# watchdog         # For faster Streamlit rerun on file changes
# xformers         # Optional: for Hugging Face transformer performance (if using specific features/models)
